A student-project word list program that will create an alphabetical list of words with corresponding frequency count from a given text file applying the Binary Search Trees.

### Contents:

- [Main](Main.java) - Main/ driver of the program.
- [BinarySearchTree](BinarySearchTree.java) - Class that performs the BST algorithm.
- [Node](Node.java) - Class that contains the left and right child, and the key word of the current node.
- [TextFiles](TextFiles.java) - Class for reading and creating text files.
- [Documentation](Documentation.pdf) - Program documentation.
- [INPUT.TXT](INPUT.TXT) - Sample input.

### Instructions:

- Run the program [main.java](main.java).
- Enter the file name including its file extension.
- If the text file is valid; it will generate a `WORD.TXT` file containing an alphabetical list of English words found in the input file, along with their corresponding frequency count. In the output file, only words with a length of at least three should be written. Otherwise, it will display `_filename_ not found.`
